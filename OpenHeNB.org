   The Femto Application Platform Interface (FAPI) is an initiative
   within the femto industry to encourage competition and innovation
   between suppliers of platform hardware, platform software and
   application software by providing a common API around which suppliers
   of each component can compete. In doing this, we imitate a long and
   distinguished engineering tradition of providing an
   “interchangeability of parts” to ensure that the systems vendors can
   take advantage of the latest innovations in silicon and software with
   the minimum of entry barrier, and the least amount of custom
   re-engineering.
